# OnlineStore
Project for MongoDB practice

Online store (built in Java as an application, not actually online, just a mockup) that integrates a MongoDB.

A user can access the site with a unique account, and based on information given, will display unique products to that person.

Time of year also affects the products displayed.

Not in development.
